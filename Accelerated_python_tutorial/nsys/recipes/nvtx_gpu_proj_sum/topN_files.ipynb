    "# Top NVTX ranges on CPU and GPU\n",
    "Users add NVTX ranges on the CPU thread to annotate the various phases of their codeâ€™s algorithms. This notebook identifies the top NVTX ranges per report according to duration. Nsight Systems automatically projects a NVTX range onto the GPU by analyzing any CUDA work launched from within that range on the same CPU thread. The projection refits the range's start and end time to tightly wrap the CUDA launches, memcopies and memsets invoked within it. The resulting duration (end-start) is then analyzed here to identify the top NVTX ranges when projected on to the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "* CUDA work launched on threads other than the one which opened & closed the range are not counted towards the projection because they may be intended for other NVTX ranges or not intended to be tracked.\n",
    "* Any NVTX ranges that start or end outside the scope of the report being analyzed are discarded.\n",
    "* Any NVTX ranges that start and end on different threads are discarded.\n",
    "* Any NVTX ranges with zero duration after GPU projection are discarded."
