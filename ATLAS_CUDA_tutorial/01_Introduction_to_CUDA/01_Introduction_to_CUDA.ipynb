    "This lab serves as an introduction to NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform, CUDA. The CUDA platform provides a general application interface for parallel computing on [CUDA-enabled GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). CUDA can be utilized from many programming languages, including C/C++, Fortran, and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overall CUDA architecture, and the concept of accelerated computing\n",
    "- CUDA C++, an extension to standard C++ that enables GPU accelerated computing\n",
    "- How to accelerate common operations such as for loops on GPUs with CUDA\n",
    "- How to allocate and work with memory on GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lab, you will be able to take a standard serial C++ code, convert it into a parallel CUDA program, and possibly see a very significant speedup by running the program on an NVIDIA GPU.

    "Every CUDA runtime API call returns an error code. It's good practice (especially if you're having trouble) to rigorously check these error codes. The error code is type `cudaError_t` (which is an integer). If the value of the error is `cudaSuccess` (0) then the CUDA API call returned without errors. Otherwise some error occurred, and CUDA provides a number of error codes corresponding to different failure conditions. See the [error handling](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__ERROR.html#group__CUDART__ERROR) section of the CUDA Runtime API for more information, and specifically you view the [cudaError enum](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__TYPES.html#group__CUDART__TYPES_1g3f51e3575c2178246db0a94a430e0038) for a list of the different error codes.\n",

    "        printf(\"CUDA error %d\\n\", err);\n",
    "        exit(-1);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you won't have the error codes memorized by heart, CUDA provides a convenience function `cudaGetErrorString` for returning a human-readable string corresponding to a given error code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    int* a;\n",
    "    // Illegal: cannot allocate a negative number of bytes\n",

    "        exit(-1);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional issue to handle is that `__global__` functions have void return type; how do we get errors that occur in kernels? These errors can come in two flavors. One class of errors is errors in the kernel launch API (the triple chevron syntax is just syntactic sugar that maps to an actual CUDA runtime API call, `cudaLaunchKernel`). To detect any errors in the kernel launch (that is, an invalid parameter), we can use the API call `cudaGetLastError()` which returns the error code for whatever the last CUDA API call was. The second class of error is an error that occurs asynchronously during the kernel launch. `cudaGetLastError()` called immediately after the kernel will not generally pick this up (the error may not have even happened by the time it checks). But fortunately, if an asynchronous error has been detected, the next CUDA runtime API will catch it. So if we insert a `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after the kernel, this call will return any errors associated with the kernel launch. \n",
